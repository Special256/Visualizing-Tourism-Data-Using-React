# Visualizing-Tourism-Data-Using-React
In this repository, I used react to visualize some korean tourism data through, pie chart, graph, table and google map.
Some of the hooks used in this project include;
  1. useState
  2. useEffect
  3. useParams
  4. useSearchParams
  
  For the map, i used the GoogleMap API which is open source
 
 The main purpose of this project was to learn how to use routers in react which included using;
  - NavLink
  - Outlet
  
 'App.js' serves as the main file.
 
 To use, please install npm to your enviroment.
 You will have to install other dependencies according to the modules in the code
 But usuall 
    'npm install' should do....
